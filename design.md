# Meridian — Project Management Design

Clean editorial productivity workspace for local Windows use and a separate sample-data preview.

Dark ink navigation (#172827), mint/teal accent (#167666), warm off-white canvas (#f5f6f3), white panels and subdued borders (#e1e6e1). A 232px sidebar, 40px gutters and a project table/activity rail create a purposeful, asymmetric dashboard. Panels have 10px corners. Completed items are green, work in progress blue, review amber, todo gray. Use visible keyboard focus, confirmation dialogs, pending/error states, reduced-motion support and accessible status selectors alongside drag-and-drop.

## Brand & Colors

One token set, consumed per platform:

- **Web & desktop**: CSS variables in `packages/web/src/web/styles.css` (desktop loads the web UI).
- **Mobile**: `Colors.light` / `Colors.dark` in `packages/mobile/constants/theme.ts`, read via `useColors()`; `userInterfaceStyle: "automatic"` follows the system light/dark setting.

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|-------|-------|------|-----|
| primary | #1F1F1F | #E5E5E5 | Buttons, active tab, accents |
| background | #FFFFFF | #0A0A0A | Page/screen background |
| card | #FFFFFF | #1A1A1A | Cards, surfaces |
| foreground | #171717 | #FAFAFA | Primary text |
| mutedForeground | #737373 | #A3A3A3 | Secondary text |
| border | #E5E5E5 | #262626 | Hairlines |
| destructive | #DC2626 | #EF4444 | Delete / errors |

## Typography

Poppins display and body: 30px headings, 13–14px controls, 12px metadata, 1.6 line height. Self-host in public/fonts with system fallback. Tables emphasize readability rather than decoration.

## Pages & Screens

List each page/screen, its route file, and what it shows. Example:

- **Web — Home** (`packages/web/src/web/pages/index.tsx`) — what the user sees first.
- **Mobile — Home** (`packages/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) — main tab.
- Add web pages under `src/web/pages/` (+ route in `app.tsx`); mobile tabs under `app/(tabs)/`, stack/modal screens under `app/`.

## Key User Flows

1. Describe the primary flow end to end (open → action → result).
2. ...

## Architecture

- **API**: typed oRPC client (`lib/api.ts` in each package) → the backend in `@template/web`. Query/mutation hooks live in `queries/` (one file per feature); pages/screens call them with `@tanstack/react-query`.
- **State/sync**: TanStack Query with optimistic updates for instant-feel interactions.
- **Auth / payments / uploads**: see `skills/app/references/` when those features are needed.
